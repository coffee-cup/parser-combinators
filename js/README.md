# parser-combinator-js

This is a parser combinator implementation in JavaScript. Most of the code was taken from Chet Corcos in [this medium article](https://medium.com/@chetcorcos/introduction-to-parsers-644d1b5d7f3d).

## Usage

- `yarn install`
- `yarn run test`

Look at `src/index.js` or `test/parser.test.js` for examples on how the parser works.
